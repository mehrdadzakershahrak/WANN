# Introduction
We believe that agent research should be for everyone to benefit from. Similar to the computer revolution,
we are sitting at a time in history where we truly are heading down the road that one day will lead to 
artificial general intelligence and potentially forms of realized singularity.

To that end our goal is not only for AGI but for what it can do to better the lives of those that need it, as well
as to impact the human race so that we can focus more on the things in life that really matter.
